In this work, I worked on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. I was hired by non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. My job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. I also identified causes that impacted the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools.
